# MAG-NET (Multi task attention guided network for tumor classification and segmentation)
MAG-Net is proposed for propoer diagnosis of brain tumor by segmenting and classifying it.
You can directly access the code and run it on Google Colab by https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IYQO7HjRpKsa_uUfQmDwxwvR8uu-463n?usp=sharing

# What is included?

* Attention based encoder-decoder architecture.
* Optimization of parameters.
* Parallel Separable Conv 2D layers in encoder block.
* Average pooling 2D layer.
* Better performance then other popular state of the art methods.
